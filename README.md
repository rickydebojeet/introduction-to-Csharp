# Introduction to C#

C# pronounced as *C Sharp* is a Object Oriented Programming Language by Microsoft. It is derived from C, C++, Java, Visual Basic. It is a modern language with type safe and garbage collection unlike C++ and its predecessor C. But we can use unsafe operation like pointers, and arrow operations but it will make the program type unsafe.

This repository is meant to be used with the book *"Programming in C# : A Primer"* by **E Balagurusamy**.

The repository is divided into 2 parts:

- **Basics:** The basics goes through the simple programs that are meant for explaination how the syntax works in C# language.

- **Excercises:** The excercise problems of the book that is solved using the C# language.

I am currently planning to include more modules in this repository including DSA *(Data Structures and Algorithms)* which has some flavours of OOP *(Objected Oriented Programming)*

## Pre-Requisites

.NET Framework is required to compile the code into MSIL *(Intermediate Language)* using the CLR *(Common Language Runtime)*

## Usage

For compiling the C# files:
```sh
csc <filename.cs>
```
For running the executable file in Windows:
```sh
<filename.exe>
```
For running the executable file in mac OS (using mono):
```sh
mono <filename.exe>
```

## Roadmap

Follow this route if you are a beginner it will start with total basics, including some problems.

- Intruduction (Get some familirization with its syntax)
	* [A simple C# Program](./)
	* [Using Aliasing](./)
	* [Printing String Variables](./)
    * [Command Line Inputs as arguments](./)
