# Chapter 6: Decision Making and Branching

Normally a set of statements in a program is executed sequentially but normally that's not what we want. We might want to to change the order of execution of statements based on certain conditions.

When the branching is based on a particular condition, it is known as conditional branching. If branching takes place without any decision, it is known as unconditional branching.

C# language has the following control or decision-making statements:
  1. `if` statement
  2. `switch` statement
  3. Conditional operator statement

#### **Familirization with Decision Making**
The if statement can be implemented in different forms depending on the complexity of the conditions to be tested.
1. **[Simple if Statement](./Practice/Program1.cs):** In this program we have used simple if statement to count students that is meeting the criteria `weight < 50 && height > 170`. You may ignore the for loop as we are going to learn about it in the next lesson. 

    One thing that should be noted is that in case of C programming language `a == b` resulted to a integer value i.e 1 or 0 so error such as `a = b` was undected by the compiler. But in case of C# the code `a == b` results to a boolean value. So error detection is definite.
